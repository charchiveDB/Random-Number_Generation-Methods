```{r}
n <- 10000
rzigg(NA, 100)
```

Assume we generate 100000 with Ziggurat method and they're actually normal, using rnorm() for now

# A chi-squared goodness of fit test (Knuth 1997) is used to check the distribution of the random variables generated. This test quantizes the horizontal axis of the probability density function into k bins and derives a single value as a quality metric from the determined actual and expected number of samples in each bin.
